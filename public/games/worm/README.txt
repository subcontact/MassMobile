The Worm Design

There are two halfs to the screen, a top and a bottom.
They are both titled something (good/bad, like dislike, approve/disaporve, rock/crack)

The worm goes for exactly 120 seconds.

The results from the handsets are aggregated on the client to an average.

Every second a spot is drawn on the screen. Each time it moves from its last position
to X percent of the new position. This stops it jumping too much. The values range from -90
to +90 as per the gyroscopes.
